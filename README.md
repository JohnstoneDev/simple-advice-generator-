# Simple Random Advice Generator.

### This project uses bootstrap and vanilla javascript to create a random advice generator

### The https://api.adviceslip.com/ API provides the advice in a json object that is then populated in an advice element on the html page.

### The page also includes a form that can be used to create a personal quote which will be displayed with an ID inside the advice elements.

#### Majority of the elements on the page are formatted using bootstrap classes. The index.css file has been used to set some global values I thought appropriate.
